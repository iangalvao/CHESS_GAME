# Chess Game Project

## Overview
This project is a Python-based chess game that integrates a visualization layer using Pygame and utilizes the `python-chess` library for game logic and Stockfish as the AI opponent. It aims to provide a modular architecture for easy development and future expansion.

---

## Features
- Interactive chess game playable against the Stockfish engine.
- Modular architecture for easy maintenance and scalability.
- Pygame visualization for a graphical user interface.
- Support for move validation, legal moves, and game-over detection.

Current Implementation
1. Console-Based Game (my_chess.py)
Interactive chess game against Stockfish with move input/output through the console.
Uses chess.Board for game state and chess.engine.SimpleEngine for AI interaction.
Move validation and game-over checks implemented.
2. Pygame Visualization
Planned as the next phase, integrating Pygame for graphical visualization of the chessboard.
Highlights:
Modular board and UI components.
Support for mouse input to select and move pieces.
Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Console Implementation âœ…
Implemented a functional chess game playable in the terminal.
Phase 2: Pygame Visualization ðŸš§
Create a graphical chessboard.
Integrate chess.Board logic with the Pygame layer.
Add drag-and-drop or click-based piece movement.
Phase 3: Enhancements
AI difficulty levels using Stockfish.
Online multiplayer support.
UI polish and additional game features (e.g., move history, undo).
